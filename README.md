# Student ID Filler

This extension allows you to never have to worry about remembering your student ID again by autofilling all ID fields on Google Forms for you! Simply enter your ID once, and never worry again as the extension does all the work for you every time a form is opened. Created by a very forgetful student :)

## FAQ

#### Do you collect my ID or use it in any way?

Your ID is only being stored in chrome's sync storage, meaning that it  is not being collected. The only reason for storing your ID locally is to be able to autofill whenever a form requires it. TLDR: No one else has access to your ID but you.

#### Why can't you just memorize your ID?

- Not everyone wants to memorize a random sequence of numbers 
- Even if you have your ID memorized, this extension still saves you the time of having to write it every time you fill out a form that asks you to do so 

#### Why does the onboarding page look so sketchy?

- Because, my friend, I am a developer, not a designer. If you are willing to contribute to the design, I will happily accept your help :)
